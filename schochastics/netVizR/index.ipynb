    "Most network analytic tasks are fairly straightforward to do in R. But when it comes to visualizing\n",
    "networks, R may lack behind some standalone software tools. Not because it is not possible to produce nice\n",
    "figures, but rather because it requires some time to obtain pleasing results.\n",
    "Just take a look at the default output when plotting a network with the `plot()` function.\n",

    "It is definitely possible to produce nice figures with the igraph package (Check out [this](https://kateto.net/networks-r-igraph) wonderful tutorial), yet it may take some time\n",
    "to familiarize yourself with the syntax. Additionally, most of the layout algorithms of `igraph` \n",
    "are non-deterministic. This means that running the same plot call twice may produce different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of `ggraph`, the \"`ggplot2` of networks\", together with\n",
    "the `graphlayouts` package, which introduces additional useful layout algorithms to R. \n",
    "Arguably, using `ggraph` is not really easier than `igraph`. But once the underlying \n",
    "principle of the *grammar of graphics* is understood, you'll see that it is actually quite intuitive to work with. \n",

    "## Multilevel networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will get to know  `layout_as_multilevel()`, a layout algorithm in the `raphlayouts` package which\n",
    "can be use to visualize multilevel networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "A multilevel network consists of two (or more) levels \n",
    "with different node sets and intra-level ties. For instance, one level could be scientists and their collaborative ties and the\n",
    "second level are labs and ties among them, and inter-level edges are the affiliations of scientists and labs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `graphlayouts` package contains an artificial multilevel network which will be used to illustrate the algorithm.\n",
    "```{r data}\n",
    "data(\"multilvl_ex\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The package assumes that a multilevel network has a vertex attribute called `lvl` which\n",
    "holds the level information (1 or 2). \n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying algorithm of `layout_as_multilevel()` has three different versions, \n",
    "which can be used to emphasize different structural features of a multilevel network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent of which option is chosen, the algorithm internally produces a 3D layout, where\n",
    "each level is positioned on a different y-plane. The 3D layout is then mapped to 2D with an [isometric projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection).\n",
    "The parameters `alpha` and `beta` control the perspective of the projection.\n",
    "The default values seem to work for many instances, but may not always be optimal. \n",
    "As a rough guideline: `beta` rotates the plot around the y axis (in 3D) and `alpha` moves the POV up or down.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complete layout\n",
    "\n",
    "A layout for the complete network can be computed via `layout_as_multilevel()` setting `type = \"all\"`.\n",
    "Internally, the algorithm produces a constrained 3D stress layout (each level on a different y plane) which is then \n",
    "projected to 2D. This layout ignores potential differences in each level and optimizes only the overall layout.\n",
    "\n",
