This folder has the purpose of containing the scripts needed to map qmd_specific stuff that should not be
downcompilied to the output file.

1. run the compilation with quarto profile postrender, this will trigger a post_render_script
2. the postrender_script will manipulate the index.md and add specific stuff from the original .qmd file
