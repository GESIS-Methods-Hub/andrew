# Exploring Tools on GESIS Binder

Welcome! This guide will walk you through how to explore various tools directly on [GESIS Binder](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/). GESIS Binder provides an interactive environment where you can run Jupyter Notebooks and experiment with various tools without needing to set up anything on your local machine.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Finding Your Tool**
    - You will find several tools and notebooks available in the KODAQS Toolbox.
    - On each tool's page, look for the "Open on BinderHub" button. This will lead you to an executable version of the notebook.

2. **Launching the Tool**
    - Click the **Open on BinderHub** button.
    - This will load the tool in an interactive Jupyter Notebook within Binder. This might take a minute.

3. **Trying Out the Tools**
    - Most tools come with a hands-on notebook (.ipynb) out of the box. If not, you can create your own notebook and copy the code examples there. The environment will be setup to run your code!
    - Remember to select R kernel for R-based tools
    - Each tool comes with pre-configured code cells that you can run and modify.
    - To run a cell, simply select it and press **Shift + Enter** or click on the **Run** button in the toolbar.

4. **Experiment and Learn**
    - The notebook environment allows you to try out different inputs and parameters to see how the tool behaves.
    - Feel free to modify the cells or add new ones to test out your ideas!

## Tips for a Smooth Experience

- **Save Your Work**: If you want to keep a copy of your work, download the notebook by going to **File > Download** and selecting **.ipynb** format.
- **Resetting the Environment**: Since Binder instances are temporary, refreshing the page will reset your environment. Save your work if you need to preserve your progress.

Now you're all set to dive in! Enjoy exploring and experimenting with the tools on GESIS Binder.
