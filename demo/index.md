Welcome to the demo of [`methodshub`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/methodshub). This is a minimal working example of the portal generated by [`methodshub`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/methodshub) and render by [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) using its default style. The style can be customised by providing a [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) file (more details at [Quarto's documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-output.html#html-styles)). Commenting by third-party software like [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) and [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) can be enable (more details at [Quarto's documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#commenting)).
